# ML Workshop #
In this workshop, training Logistic Regression with a TF-IDF vectorizer on two different datasets and fine-tuning DistilBert are demonstrated.

1. In [tf_idf_vectorizer.ipynb](https://github.com/berkedilekoglu/ml_course_workshop/blob/main/tf_idf_vectorizer.ipynb), you can find Logistic Regression predictions made on two different datasets, one in Turkish and one in English.
2. In [distilbert.ipynb](https://github.com/berkedilekoglu/ml_course_workshop/blob/main/distilbert.ipynb), you can see how to fine-tune the DistilBert model using the IMDB dataset.
